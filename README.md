Purpose:
-----------
Hydrolinking refers to the linkage of observations and spatial feature data to a stream network.  This is similar to the analogy of addresses in a road network.  This effort will focus on hydrolinking of data to the National Hydrography Datasets (NHD), both the NHDPlusV2.1 Medium Resolution and NHD High Resolution.  

Hydrolinking data to the NHD provides context to the hydrographic network and makes it possible to access other known information across the stream network.
